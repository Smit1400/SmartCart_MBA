    "**Task**: Your objective is to analyze a dataset provided to you, which contains information in the form of rows and columns related to e-commerce transactions. Utilize your analytical skills to examine the data and extract valuable insights that can inform business decisions, such as inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer satisfaction initiatives, and after you do all this, return those insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration**: Start by understanding the dataset's structure, including the number of rows and columns and the types of data (numerical, categorical) it contains. Identify key columns that could provide valuable insights, such as product names, quantities sold, prices, and transaction countries.\n",
    "2. **Data Processing and Analysis**: Clean and preprocess the data if necessary. Then, conduct an in-depth analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies. Focus on identifying top-selling products, revenue-generating items, sales distribution by country, average purchase values, and products with high return rates.\n",
    "3. **Insight Extraction**: Based on your analysis, extract actionable insights that could help a business executive make informed decisions. This might include recommendations on stocking up certain products, identifying products that contribute most to the revenue, understanding market dynamics across different regions, and addressing issues related to product returns.\n",
    "4. **Reporting and Visualization**: Present your findings in a clear and understandable manner, supported by data visualizations where appropriate. Your report should highlight key insights and suggest actions that could improve the business's performance.\n",

    "*OUTPUT EXPECTATION*:\n",
    "The expected outcome is a comprehensive report containing actionable insights derived from the dataset. These insights should inform business strategies such as which products to stock more of, how to enhance marketing efforts, understanding customer preferences, and how to reduce return rates. The insights should be presented in a manner that is easily understandable by business executives, focusing on improving profitability and customer satisfaction.\n",
